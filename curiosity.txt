This is an example of some experimentation I was doing with React and Tailwind:

import react from "./assets/React.png";
import tailwind from "./assets/TailwindCSS.png";

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center flex-col bg-slate-900">
            <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-slate-400">React + Tailwind CSS!</h1>
            <div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-10 gap-10">
                <img className="w-24 h-21" src={react} alt="React"/>
                <img className="w-24 h-16" src={tailwind} alt="Tailwind"/>
            </div>
            <button className="text-base mt-10 bg-slate-800 text-white p-5 rounded-full"
            onClick={() => alert("Welcome to React + Tailwind!")}>Click Me!</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App;

Followind this logic (and if I start building projects like this), rather than having a seprate
file for HTML, CSS and JavaScript all my code would just be in one, so would this made coding
faster? Also how significant would this be to employers and other Junior Developers? Is it seen
as more practical or impressive?
